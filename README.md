# Daily Text web scraper

The purpose of this app is to retrieve today's Daily Text from WOL
and output the plain text.

Presently it outputs the text in a modified format optimized for
speech with the `say` command in MacOS.

This limited form of output is purely because the script was just
written. I'll be adding some console execution flags to allow various
behaviors. Coming soon.
